# What's new



### 2023.4

Paper [CHAM：A Customized Homomorphic Encryption Accelerator for Fast Matrix-Vector Product] accepted by DAC 2023.

[An Attack on RIAC Homomorphic Encryption Algorithm](http://www.jcr.cacrnet.org.cn/CN/10.13868/j.cnki.jcr.000604) was published in Journal of Cryptologic Research (in Chinese). It describes how we broke the [RIAC (Random iterative affine cipher)](https://fate.readthedocs.io/en/develop-1.5/_build_temp/python/federatedml/secureprotol/README.html#iterativeaffine-homomorphic-encryption) in 2022.1.

### 2023.2

Paper [Squirrel: A Scalable Secure Two-Party Computation Framework for Training Gradient Boosting Decision Tree](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/527) accepted by USENIX'Sec 2023.

### 2023.1

**We have moved to** [**Ant Group**](https://www.antgroup.com/en)! 

### Prior works at Alibaba Gemini Lab

>We just deliver a major update to [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted),  including benchmarks on several PPML operations such as NN training and inference. Please check the new [performance section](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted/blob/master/README.md#performance).

2022.3
>The [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL) homomorphic encryption library released version 4.0,  including the [BGV implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/pull/283) we contributed.

>We found that the [RIAC (Random iterative affine cipher)](https://fate.readthedocs.io/en/develop-1.5/_build_temp/python/federatedml/secureprotol/README.html#iterativeaffine-homomorphic-encryption) used in several federated learning frameworks is broken. Please **immediately** stop using RIAC and check previous RIAC ciphertexts if there's any. We have contacted the [affected community](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BoW184Uhf7iF_uZlMZhnMg) and will publish the exploit details once we are allowed.
